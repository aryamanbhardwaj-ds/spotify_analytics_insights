🎵 Spotify Streaming Trends & Insights Dashboard 📊
📌 Project Overview
This repository showcases a comprehensive Spotify Analytics Dashboard 🎧 built using Power BI. The project transforms raw music streaming data into a high-impact visual tool designed to help record labels and artists understand market trends, listener behavior, and song performance metrics.

🛠️ Technical Workflow & Features
Since this project is contained within a .pbix file, the technical complexity is handled through internal logic:

1. 🔍 Data Transformation (Power Query)
ETL Excellence: Cleaned and pre-processed the raw Spotify dataset to ensure 100% data accuracy. ✅

Feature Engineering: Created custom date hierarchies (Year, Quarter, Month) to enable granular time-series analysis. 📅

Data Scrubbing: Handled missing values and standardized artist/track naming conventions for seamless filtering. 🧹

2. 🧠 Analytical Modeling (DAX)
I authored custom DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to unlock deeper business insights, including:

🔥 Popularity Index: A dynamic measure calculating track success based on streaming volume and energy scores.

📈 Growth Metrics: Identifying Year-over-Year (YoY) trends in artist followers and play counts.

🎯 Performance KPIs: Calculated averages for audio features like 'Acousticness' and 'Danceability' to find the "formula" for a hit song.

3. 🎨 User Experience (UI/UX)
Dynamic Slicers: Users can filter the entire report by Genre, Year, or Artist with a single click. 🖱️

Interactive Navigation: Implemented bookmarks and selection panes for a clean, app-like navigation experience. 📱

Thematic Design: Custom-designed UI to match the Spotify brand aesthetic using custom icons and color palettes. 🟢⚫

💡 Key Business Insights
Genre Evolution: Identified which genres are gaining momentum in the current market. 🚀

Audio DNA: Discovered the correlation between track "Energy" and its placement on global top-charts. 🎼

Listener Engagement: Highlighted peak streaming periods to assist in strategic release planning. ⏰
