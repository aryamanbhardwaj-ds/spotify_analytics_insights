📌 Project Overview
This project transforms raw Spotify streaming data into a comprehensive analytical tool using Power BI. The dashboard provides a deep dive into music consumption patterns, artist performance metrics, and track attributes. By leveraging data visualization, it identifies high-growth genres and the characteristics of top-charting music to assist record labels and artists in making data-driven decisions.

🚀 Key Features & Insights

Artist Performance KPIs: Dynamic tracking of artist popularity, follower growth, and total streams over specific time periods.

🛠️ Technical Workflow
1. Data Transformation (Power Query)
Performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to clean raw datasets.

Handled null values, standardized date formats, and normalized artist/track metadata for consistency.

Restructured data into a Star Schema for optimized query performance.

2. Analytical Modeling (DAX)
Authoring custom Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create advanced metrics, including:

Total Streams: SUM(Streaming_Data[Streams])


Popularity Ranking: Dynamic ranking of tracks based on a weighted score of streams and energy.

Year-over-Year Growth: Time intelligence functions to track artist growth trends.

3. Visual Storytelling
Utilized Slicers for dynamic filtering by Genre, Artist, and Release Year.

Implemented Custom Visuals and custom icons to match the Spotify brand aesthetic.

Used Cross-filtering to allow users to click an artist and see their entire performance history across the dashboard.

📈 Impact for Business
This dashboard serves as a strategic asset for:

Music Producers: To understand which track characteristics (e.g., higher energy) are currently resonating with listeners.

Marketing Teams: To allocate resources toward genres showing high streaming momentum.

Talent Scouts: To identify "Rising Star" artists through growth-rate metrics.
